Open any of the above documents to see examples of what they actually are and how they are used:

List of things as PM Artifacts

                   **Artifacts to use BEFORE Project Approval: **

BRD - Business Requirements Document (high level goals, and any inflexible dates or requirements with reasoning of why they are inflexible)

CBA - Cost Benefit Analysis (this is for upfront costs as well as Total Cost of Ownership [TCO] over 1-3years)

RACI - Who will do what on the team in broad terms. (Initially it can be Product X DEV Team- but a specific person from DEV will need to be named)

Event Communication plan (When we do things how will we communicate? This will be for Change Control, Outages, Deployments, and Unplanned Outages)

Charter - This is the overall plain language document that leadership agrees to and is a summarized view of BRD/CBA/RACI/Communications 

                   **Artifacts to use AFTER a Project is approved: **

Requirements Traceability matrix - (Details for what it takes to accomplish the goals. This gets to the nitty-gritty and aligns a business need with the Jira/DevOps tickets to get it done)

Timeline - When is stuff happening at a high level (Initally it can be a prioritized/dependency driven this-then-that ... but dates will be needed as targets. Do in second Sprint, 4th Sprint, etc)

RAID log / Problem Tracker - Risks/Actions/Issues/Decisions (This is a list where Leadership or Project Team needs to engage)

Project Plan - GANNT style listing of what goes when, concurrent and/or dependencies -- This is not promoting Waterfall (this then that) - it is listing blocks of work in an easy to consume format

Executive Summary Deck - High level 1page Summary Report of project status (be more than Red/Yellow/Green. Risks, Dates, Cost Tracking, Decisions needed, etc)

UAT Tracker - Who will test what scenarios when, and who will Pass/Fail before deployment (Determine what the test scenarios are and work with testers in IT and Business ahead of time)

Architecturals / Design Docs (Every project needs and understanding of what is being impacted. If it is minor, then show it and do not assume. Check upstream and downstream to verify)

Root Cause Analysis Doc - (In case of issues)  (Fishbone Option)

DR Planning Doc - Is redundancy being built? Critical Systems and Failover?

Release Planning Flow and Documentation (How and when does the team release? Are there system outages, What approvals are needed?) 

Run Book - Both DEV and Release Planning doc - it is important to have formal process that establishes before, and after, with a plan for what happens if a release runs into problems? ((Fail Forward / Fall Back)

Post implementation Close Down and checklist - what will close down look like? How long will the new release be in "Emergency Response Monitoring" after the release
